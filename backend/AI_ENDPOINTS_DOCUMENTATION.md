## Enhanced Existing Endpoints

The following existing AI endpoints have been enhanced with Gemini API integration:

### POST /api/ai/generate-code
Enhanced with context-aware code generation using Gemini API.

### POST /api/ai/review-code
Upgraded to provide detailed, structured code reviews with security and performance insights.

### POST /api/ai/explain-code
Improved to give educational, step-by-step code explanations.

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
```

### Mock Responses
When `GEMINI_API_KEY` is not configured or set to `your-gemini-api-key-here`, the endpoints return mock responses with `isMockResponse: true`.

---

## Error Handling

### 400 Bad Request
```json
{
  "error": "Question is required"
}
```

### 401 Unauthorized
```json
{
  "error": "Access denied. No token provided."
}
```

### 500 Internal Server Error
```json
{
  "error": "Failed to get AI mentor response"
}
```

---

## Database Integration

The AI endpoints integrate with the following database models:
- **Questions**: For contextual mentor responses
- **Snippets**: For code-related context
- **Resumes**: For storing review history
- **SkillRatings**: For tracking user skill development

## Testing

### Sample cURL Commands

#### Test AI Mentor
```bash
# Register user
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "testuser", "email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123"}'

# Login to get token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "password123"}' | jq -r '.token')

# Test AI Mentor
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/mentor \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "question": "How do I handle errors in async/await?",
    "codeSnippet": "async function fetchData() {\n  const response = await fetch('/api/data');\n  return response.json();\n}"
  }'
```

#### Test Resume Review
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/resumeReview \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "resumeText": "John Doe\nSoftware Engineer\n\nEXPERIENCE:\n- 3 years full-stack development\n- React, Node.js, PostgreSQL\n\nSKILLS:\nJavaScript, React, Node.js, SQL"
  }'
```

#### Test Skill Rater
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/skillRater \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "skillName": "Docker"
  }'
```

## Rate Limits and Best Practices

1. **API Key Management**: Secure your Gemini API key and never expose it in client-side code
2. **Response Handling**: Always check `isMockResponse` to determine if using real AI or mock data
3. **Database Context**: The system automatically fetches related content for enhanced responses
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for network and AI service failures
5. **Caching**: Consider implementing response caching for similar queries to reduce API costs

---

## Future Enhancements

- **LangChain Integration**: Planned integration for more sophisticated context retrieval
- **Response Caching**: Cache similar queries to optimize performance and costs
- **User Preferences**: Customize AI responses based on user skill level and preferences
- **Multi-modal Support**: Support for image analysis in code screenshots and resume PDFs
